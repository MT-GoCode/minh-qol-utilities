# pacemaker

Turn a command that is normally a silent wait into one that pings you.

Built to be run **by Monitor**, which executes it and turns every line it prints into a
notification. In a plain shell it works but it is talking to nobody.

```
Monitor(pacemaker --slug build -- make -j8)        a job
Monitor(pacemaker --slug ci --every 120)           a bare reminder, no command
Monitor(pacemaker --slug build --attach)           resume after Monitor expires
```

| flag | default | |
| :- | :- | :- |
| `--slug` | required | names the run. You choose it, so you can always `--attach` |
| `--every` | `75` | seconds between pings, max 1200 (20m) |
| `--timeout` | none | kill the job after this many seconds, max 1800 |
| `--attach` | | resume watching a run that is already going |
| `--list` | | every run on this machine, its state and its command |
| `--selftest` | | run the behavioural checks against this copy |

With no command it is a bare timer — nothing to launch, nothing to detach, no files kept:

```
Heartbeat. Reminder to check on ci — 22m00s since this reminder was armed.
```

It holds no state, so that clock restarts when you re-arm. The wording says so rather than
claiming a total it cannot know.

## What it does

**Under 60 seconds it says nothing**, then hands back the result:

```
build completed in 12s with exit code 0.
hello
stderr:
a warning
```

So for anything short it behaves much like running the command directly — with two
differences worth knowing: more than 50 lines per stream is truncated to a head and a tail
(the log has all of it), and pacemaker's own exit status is not the job's. The job's code is
in the completion line. Past 60 seconds it
starts reporting, and keeps whatever the job wrote attached to the ping:

```
Heartbeat. build running for 4m12s.
Compiling serde v1.0.210
Compiling tokio v1.40.0
```

```
Heartbeat. build running for 9m30s. Quiet for 5m01s. Is this hung, or is there a problem?
```

stdout is unlabelled, stderr goes under `stderr:`. At most 50 lines per stream per ping,
keeping the head as well as the tail — a burst's phase markers are at the front, and forty
trailing `ok` lines are its least informative slice.

A job can also write faster than pacemaker polls. It reads at most 64 KiB from each end of
whatever arrived, never the whole delta, so a run that prints 5 MB in one burst still costs
well under a kilobyte of notification and a fixed amount of memory:

```
... 412 lines omitted and 4761KB never read, full log at ~/.pacemaker/sweep/stdout ...
```

The *log* is complete; only the ping is abridged. "never read" is the honest part — the
line count either side of a skip is a floor, and saying so beats a confident wrong total.

**Eager, and there is no other mode.** It pings when a burst *settles* (1.5s of quiet),
not on a clock. Two flat numbers bound it: **at most one ping per 20s, at least one per
`--every`.**

The floor is a constant rather than a fraction of `--every` so both are statable on their
own. It binds only on *bursty* jobs — a continuously chatty one never goes quiet for 1.5s,
so it never takes the eager path and reports on the `--every` clock instead. The trade,
stated plainly: raising `--every` slows the silence pings but not a bursty job, because an
eager ping always carries new output. It is news, not noise.

## Surviving Monitor

Monitor caps at 30 minutes and kills what it is running. pacemaker dies; **the job does
not**. It is double-forked and reparented to init, so when the expiry notice arrives:

```
Monitor(pacemaker --slug build --attach)
```

picks it back up — elapsed still measured from the real start, and nothing in the gap is
lost, because the job has been writing to files the whole time.

A new session alone is *not* enough here, which is the non-obvious part: this harness kills
the process **tree**, and while pacemaker is still the job's parent the walk finds it
whatever session it is in. Measured — the job died. Hence two forks, not one.

## Where things go

```
~/.pacemaker/<slug>/stdout      the job's stdout
~/.pacemaker/<slug>/stderr      its stderr
~/.pacemaker/<slug>/exit        appears when it finishes, holds the code
~/.pacemaker/<slug>/meta        pid, start time, the command
~/.pacemaker/<slug>-<when>/     the previous run under this slug, kept
```

Not `/tmp`: these outlive the run and `grep` works on them later. Pruning happens between
runs — older than 7 days, or oldest-first above 500 MB — and **only ever touches runs that
have an `exit` file**. A live run's directory cannot be deleted out from under it, which
matters because a job whose directory vanishes keeps writing into an unlinked inode and can
never report that it finished.

## Buffering will fool it

`quiet` measures when the log last grew, which is flush cadence, not progress. A job
printing steadily into an 8 KiB stdio buffer writes nothing for minutes and reads as hung.

pacemaker launches everything under `stdbuf -oL -eL` with `PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1`, which
covers libc programs and Python — note `stdbuf` alone does **nothing** for Python, and
`python3 -u` does **not** survive a later pipe stage. Go and Java still buffer on their own
terms. That is why the line asks *"Is this hung, or is there a problem?"* rather than
asserting it.

## Killing a run

`--timeout` does it on a clock. By hand:

```sh
kill -TERM -$(python3 -c "import json;print(json.load(open('$HOME/.pacemaker/build/meta'))['pid'])")
```

The negative matters: the job is its own process-group leader, and killing the bare pid
orphans the command underneath it.

## Install

```sh
./install.sh          # one file to ~/.local/bin, no sudo
pacemaker --selftest  # the checks, from wherever it is installed
./uninstall.sh
```

**The tests are in the tool**, not beside it, so `pacemaker --selftest` works on any
machine that has pacemaker — no clone, no second file to copy. That is the whole reason
it is a flag and not a `test.sh`: validating a Mac used to mean shipping files around.

They assert behaviour from outside the process, because unit-style checking missed every
bug that actually shipped here. Being Python rather than shell also removes the test
layer's own portability problem: macOS has no `timeout(1)`, and where coreutils supplies
one it is on the **login** shell's PATH, which is not what ssh gives you.
